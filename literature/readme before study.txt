You may find the list of papers that I found related to our problem.
Most papers also gives the link to the code available on github. 
Among these papers, attention, gcn and aaai generalization are the ones that I read in detail.
I have studied attention for a long time and have the simplified code that is also trainable. I will share also that soon.
The one I named rethinking makes good points on generalization to the larger instances and limitations.
Graph pointers also seems interesting and worth reading since it seems unique in terms of the GNN arhitecture but it seemed complicated to me so I could not understand it fully yet.
lense is not exactly the same problem of interest as ours but seemed somewhat related, not read in detail yet.
